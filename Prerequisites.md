## PRE-REQUISITES:

- First you need to install angular CLI with the help of npm. And for that, you need to install Node.js

  a) Download Node.js using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/  (Download the LTS version)

  b) After downloading and installing, now open command prompt as Administrator
  
  c) On the CLI write, npm install -g @angular/cli ( if using MAC write sudo prior to this command)
