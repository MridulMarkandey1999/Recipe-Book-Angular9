## PRE-REQUISITES:

- First you need to install angular CLI with the help of npm. And for that, you need to install Node.js

  a) Download Node.js using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/  (Download the LTS version)

  b) After downloading and installing, now open command prompt as Administrator
  
  c) On the CLI write, npm install -g @angular/cli ( if using MAC write sudo prior to this command)

  d)Then type these commands:( donâ€™t include $ ) ( in command prompt running as administrator )
  
        $ ng new final-project

        $ cd final-project
          
  e) Also you must have one IDE. I have used Visual Studio for this. You can download the same from here: 
        
        https://code.visualstudio.com/download
        
        
- You must have bootstrap version 3. Run these commands in command prompt ( as administrator )
        
        $ npm install --save bootstrap@3


- For accessing the web-app you should have a browser. So, **Chrome broswer is highly recommended**.
