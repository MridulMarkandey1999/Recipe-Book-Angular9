# Recipe-Book-Angular9
Build an awesome reactive front-end web application, with great User Experience. It basically has two sections, a recipe book, and a shopping list. You can manage your recipes, view them in detail and manage the shopping list. You can even push ingredients directly from a recipe to shopping list but for that, you must be an authorized user.
